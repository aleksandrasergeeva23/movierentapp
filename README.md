My first REST API application. This application was made for renting movies. This code is a testing task as a part of job interview.

I know that the code is not perfect, and there are plenty of moments, which I could upgrade, but I've tried to stay in given timeframes and ti show different skills and possible solutions in defferent parts of code. 

Some description of code possibilities is in word file.

For testing the program postman was used
